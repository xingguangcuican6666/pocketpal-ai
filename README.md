# PocketPal AI 📱🚀

PocketPal AI is a pocket-sized AI assistant powered by small language models (SLMs) that run directly on your phone. Designed for both iOS and Android, PocketPal AI lets you interact with various SLMs without the need for an internet connection. Your privacy is fully protected as all processing happens entirely on-device — your conversations, prompts, and data never leave your phone or get stored on external servers.

> **Note on Privacy**: The only data that may leave your device is what you explicitly choose to share: benchmark results (if you opt to contribute to the leaderboard) and any feedback you voluntarily submit through the app.

[**Get it on Google Play**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketpalai)

## Usage

### Downloading a Model

1. Open the app and tap the **Menu** icon (☰).
2. Navigate to the **Models** page.
3. Choose a model from the list and tap **Download**.
4. Or tap the + button to add models from Hugging Face or locally downloaded ones.

### Loading a Model

- After downloading, tap **Load** next to the model to load it to memory.
- You can also load a model directly within the chat page using the chevron icon on the left side of the chat input.

### Chatting with the model 

1. Ensure a model is loaded.
2. Navigate to the **Chat** page from the menu.
3. Start conversing with your AI assistant!
4. The screen will stay awake during inference and deactivate when idle.
5. You can select and load models using the chevron icon on the left side of the chat input.

### Calling the local OpenAI-compatible API (/v1/chat/completions)

PocketPal ships with a local API server (default port `8000`, enable it in **Settings → Local API**, API Key optional). **Load a local model in the app first**, and make sure the `model` field matches the active model ID (discoverable via `GET /v1/models`).  
PocketPal 内置本地 API 服务器（默认端口 `8000`，可在 **Settings → Local API** 开启并设置 API Key）。调用前请在 App 内加载本地模型；`model` 字段需与当前激活模型 ID 一致，可通过 `GET /v1/models` 获取。

```bash
# One-line JSON to avoid shell quoting issues (replace placeholders with your values)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_IF_SET" \
  -d '{"model":"REPLACE_WITH_ACTIVE_MODEL_ID_FROM_/v1/models","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are PocketPal."},{"role":"user","content":"wakeup"}],"stream":false}'

# 或先保存为文件再调用，避免多行引号被终端错误解析
cat > /tmp/pocketpal-chat.json <<'EOF'
{
  "model": "REPLACE_WITH_ACTIVE_MODEL_ID_FROM_/v1/models",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are PocketPal."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "wakeup"}
  ],
  "stream": false
}
EOF
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_IF_SET" \
  --data-binary @/tmp/pocketpal-chat.json
```

Common errors / 常见报错：
- `Model is not loaded...` → Load a local model in the app first / 请先在 App 内加载本地模型。
- `messages array is required` 或 `Object is an object, expected an array` → `messages` must be a JSON **array** exactly as shown above; using the one-line or file-based curl avoids shell quoting problems / 确保 `messages` 是数组格式，推荐使用上面的单行或文件方式。
- `Requested model \"...\" is not the active local model` → Make `model` match the active model ID / `model` 字段需与当前激活模型 ID 匹配。

### Copying Text

- **Copy Entire Response**: Tap the copy icon at the bottom of the AI's response bubble.
- **Copy Specific Paragraph**: Long-press on a paragraph to copy its content.

*Note*: Preserving text formatting while copying is currently limited. We're working on improving this feature.

### Message Editing

1. Long-press on any of your messages to edit them.
2. After editing, the AI will regenerate its response based on your changes.
3. Use the retry option to get a new response without changing your message.
4. You can also retry generation using a different model for comparison or better results.

### Using Pals

1. Create personalized AI assistants with different personalities and settings.
2. PocketPal offers two different pal types:
   - **Assistant Pal**: Select a default model, set a system prompt (manually or generated by another AI), and customize chat text input color.
   - **Roleplay Pal**: Similar to Assistant Pal plus additional settings for location, AI's role, and other contextual parameters.
3. Select a Pal using the Pal picker in the chat page to quickly switch between different personas.
